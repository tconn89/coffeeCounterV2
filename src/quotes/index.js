    "Some hearts are soft and supple\nTake a sharp knife\nor a dull one, dull can be good enough\nCut and slice it\nWatch it bleed\nDrip on the cutting room floor",
    "Sometimes two hearts can't be happy at the same time.\nWe lie under the same moon knowing our veins are pulsing in tune.\nMy eyes are open.\nYours are not",
    "I come from the stardust dancing in the wind, a hope for true love,\n and wanting to grow like an orchid or climbing ivy.",
    "From the words filling up blank pages in onyx ink, the smell of fresh lemonade next to smoke on the dancefloor.",
    "Whisper it in my ear\nBecause I'm running out of ideas\nTo show you or touch you\nTo entertain\nTell me how to love you because\nEverything I've done isn't working anymore\nAnd I don't know what to do\nJust tell me how to love you\nAnd I promise you\nI'll try",
    "You don't make my coffee right.\nYou don't make tea before I wake up.\nYou don't even like eggs that much.\nIt's okay, I don't either.\n\nBut I do like good coffee.",
    "kiss me when I'm mad\nhold me until we make up",
    "I rarely fall but when I do\nIt's fast.\nIt's hard.\nIt's the rocket past the moons of Jupiter\nStraight from the bottom of Mariana's Trench.",
    "11am and no pants\nMessed up hair, your fault\nScratches that burn in the shower, my fault",
    "My beloved city lights erased in the dark suburban sky\nDriving away from the silhouette\nBack to jaded white picket fences\nFiled in perfectly straight lines\nLives sealed safe behind a wall and dimmed porch lights\nFrom the rough city nights they'd sooner forget\n\nI'm going home, but not where I belong",
    "Because you, the drop of whiskey in my tea\nThe brash howl lost in red canyon caverns\nThe curve of your cupid's bow,\nthe pull of your shoulder blades knitting together\nwith the arch of your spine like the cascade of Saturn's rings",
    "Some hearts are made of paper\nPaper is stronger than you think\nBut it will always burn\nLight it on fire with matchsticks\nOr candle wicks for style\nVanilla scented ones"
